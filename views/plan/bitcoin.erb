        <h2>The Bitcoin Lifer Plan</h2>

        <p>
          We don't have a good way to charge recurring with Bitcoin (that adheres to Bitcoin's decentralized principles). So instead, we've put together a special <strong>Bitcoin Lifer Plan</strong>. Basically, if you send us <strong>$100</strong> worth of BTC at current market price, we'll never charge you again for the supporter upgrade, and you'll basically get it forever!
        </p>
        <p>Be sure to <a href="/contact">contact us</a> after sending with the transaction ID so we can confirm and upgrade your account.</p>

        <p>
          We generally hold Bitcoin. Many of our vendors accept Bitcoin, and we often use it to pay them.
