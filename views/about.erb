    <h6>Neocities is bringing back the fun, creativity and free expression that made the web great.</h6>

    <p>
      We are tired of living in an online world where people are isolated from each other on boring web sites with generic templates defining what people are
      supposed to know or communicate with each other. It's time we took back our personalities from these sterilized, lifeless,
      monetized, data mined, monitored entities and let our creativity flourish again.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's where Neocities comes in. We provide a canvas for people to make any web site they want.
      Whether it be a web site about something they're good at, something they love, something they hate, or
      their own completely customized profile where they can introduce themselves in a way that actually matters to them. 
      We can do this without selling out to the marketing industry, and we're going to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a tough project. We've got big problems to solve, and big ambitions (restrained by our big principles). We have a lot of work to do. <strong>But our goal is clear: to enable you to harness the creativity, beauty, and power of creating your own web site. To rebuild the web we lost to monotony, and make it fun again.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Neocities is just getting started, and we've got a lot of amazing things in store. I strongly believe that, with your help, we're going to really shake things up on the web. Thank you for believing in us (and yourselves).
    </p>
    <p>
      Long Live the Web!
    </p>
