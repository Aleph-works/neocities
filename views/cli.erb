    <p>Neocities has a CLI for power users that want to upload sites using a command line.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Push support</strong> - uploads an entire directory. Great for static site generators.
      <li><strong>HTTP persistence</strong> - the CLI reuses a single HTTP connection, improving performance.
      <li><strong>Check before upload</strong> - checks if the file data matches before uploading.
      <li><strong>Gitignore parsing</strong> - automatically skips files in root gitignore file for git repositories.
    </ul>
