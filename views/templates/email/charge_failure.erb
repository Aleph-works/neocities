Hello,

We're writing to let you know that Neocities has had an issue charging your card. We will try again automatically in a few days, but we just wanted to give you a heads up in case something is wrong with your card.

We will retry over the next few weeks. If we can't make a successful charge, your account will be downgraded from supporter to the free plan.

If you need to change the card on file, you can do so on the settings page. If you run into any issues, please contact us at https://neocities.org/contact.

Regards,
- The Neocities Team
