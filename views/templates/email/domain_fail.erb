Hello <%= site.username %>,

We have detected that your domain name <%= domain %> is no longer working with your Neocities web site, so we automatically removed it from the domain settings for your site.

This does not mean your site has been deleted! It is still up and accessible at the following location: <%= site.uri %>

If you believe your domain not working is a mistake, please check with your domain registrar and make sure the settings are correct for Neocities, and that your domain was properly renewed.

Best,
The Neocities Team
