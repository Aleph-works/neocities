Hi there!

A Neocities administrator has upgraded your account to supporter! Someone at Neocities must really like you (or your site). :)

We won't charge you for the upgrade, so no worries on that. You can see some of the new features you can use by visiting our supporter page at https://neocities.org/plan

We're looking forward to seeing the awesome things you will do with it.

Thank you very, very much for supporting Neocities. It means a lot to us. We'll try our hardest to keep improving the site and stick to our core values (NO MARKETING OR ADVERTISING, EVER).

If you have any questions or comments, or just want to say hi, feel free to contact us at https://neocities.org/contact. You can also reach us on Twitter at @neocitiesweb.

From Penelope (the Neocities' cat/sysadmin), everyone that's helped work on Neocities, and on behalf of all our sites, our very best wishes for you (and your awesome web site).

- The Neocities Team
