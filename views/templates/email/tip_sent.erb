You are awesome! You just sent a <%= @tip.amount_string %> tip to <%= @tip.site.username %> (<%= @tip.site.uri %>)!

Neocities doesn't take a cut of the tips sent to sites. Almost all of your donation (minus any transaction fees) will go directly to the site itself!

You can see the tip on your site profile at https://neocities.org/site/<%= @tip.site.username %>

When you tip sites on Neocities, you help them to continue to build awesome stuff. On behalf of all the great sites on Neocities, thank you!

If you're feeling tipsy, there's a lot of other great sites on Neocities! Check them all out at https://neocities.org/browse.
