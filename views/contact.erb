            Neocities intentionally only provides static hosting (such as HTML, CSS, JS). As such, we cannot provide access to any "back-end" programming languages. We feel that creating sites that use these languages tend to become obsolete quickly (programming languages don't stay around for very long), and that sites are best created without them unless they are complicated web applications. Also, allowing programming languages on the backend would make it much harder for us to run Neocities, for both monetary and security reasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            Front-end programming with Javascript, however, is allowed and highly encouraged!

            For security reasons, we cannot reset your password if you did not enter an email for your site. You will have to make a new site (don’t worry, it’s free!). If you didn’t get an email from the password reset form, you didn’t enter an email (or it’s in your spam folder). Again you will have to make a new site; we cannot help you for security reasons.

            We don't support FTP, sorry! Aside from security problems with FTP, it isn't used by many people anymore. We need to stay focused on what we work on, so we only support ways to upload content that most people use these days.

          <p>
            Our <a href="/api">API</a> allows you to very easily write a script to upload content if you need. We also have <a href="/site_files/mount_info">WebDAV</a> available for <a href="https://neocities.org/plan">supporter</a> accounts, which allows you to mount your Neocities site as a disk on your computer.

            Neocities intentionally does not provide any embeddable code for use within Neocities sites, because we don't want sites to become dependent on Neocities services to work. We like the idea of making static sites that last a long time, and these sorts of services tend to fade away, causing your site to stop working.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do provide services for the sites on the main site (neocities.org), such as a site profile and tagging so you can form communities of sites with similar interests. We think that's a better way to do it than to push our way into your site. You can of course link to your Neocities Site Profile (https://neocities.org/site/yourusername) from your own site if you'd like.

            We will not remove a site unless it is violating our Terms of Service or breaking the law. Chances are, it isn't. And the First Amendment of the United States Constitution defends our right to do this. Don't waste your time, we won't take it down. Sorry.
